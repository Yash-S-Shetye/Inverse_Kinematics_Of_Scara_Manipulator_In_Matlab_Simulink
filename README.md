# Inverse_Kinematics_Of_Scara_Manipulator_In_Simulink

Simulation of inverse kinematics of a scara manipulator using jacobian inverse, jacobian transpose and jacobian pseudo inverse.
Part 1 contains files for simulating inverse kinematics using jacobian inverse and jacobian transpose while Part2 contains files
for simulating inverse kinematics using jacobian pseudo-inverse.

Steps to run simulation for both parts - 

1.) Copy all the files in one folder.

2.) Change location address of the mat file - "kinematic_traj.mat" in the init file.

3.) Run the init file in matlab.

4.) To visualize the results, run the visualize_results.m file
